    Hey This is our official TOS that you will need to agree on before getting one of our products if fail to agree with our TOS you will be refused and if break TOS Discord will be contacted

    
    TOS
    You must agree on the following things
</br>
<br>   
HOSTING TOS IS HERE https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nlhqt8GyLKoSXks-qS8TUexLxrSiWL482gkLlADTKhI/edit?usp=sharing
</br>
    
<br>
    1| The Developer will leave a credit in the announcements section with our server link and a short message
</br>
<br>
    2| You must give our developer perms in the server to actually do anything at all
</br>

<br>
    3| We will make the server unless you want a revamp in which we dont need to make a complete new server
</br>
<br>
    4| At any point a developer can refuse a job But Must have a valid reason approved by owner or co owners
</br>
<br>
    5| We don't do role or channel perms out of respect for the owner and co owner as it is important you know what roles have access to what channels
</br>
<br>
    6| Any logo or livery work will have a watermark on it before you pay and once you have paid you will receive without a watermark to stop copyright breaches
</br> 
<br>   
    This is also soon to change depending on how people respond to TOS
</br>
